# 10) Write a shell script finder-app/writer.sh as described below
# 
# Accepts the following arguments: the first argument is a full path to a file (including filename) on the filesystem, referred to below as writefile; the second argument is a text string which will be written within this file, referred to below as writestr
# 
# Exits with value 1 error and print statements if any of the arguments above were not specified
# 
# Creates a new file with name and path writefile with content writestr, overwriting any existing file and creating the path if it doesnâ€™t exist. Exits with value 1 and error print statement if the file could not be created.
# 
# Example:
# 
#        writer.sh /tmp/aesd/assignment1/sample.txt ios
# 
# Creates file:
# 
#     /tmp/aesd/assignment1/sample.txt
# 
#             With content:
# 
#             ios
